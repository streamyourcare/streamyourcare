# Care Streaming Exploitation Prevention Guidelines

Due to the complex nature of care systems and community crowdsourcing, some guidelines should be established to prevent individuals from being taken advantage of through this community.

* **[Care Stream Content]** posts will be examined by community moderators to ensure the support links & handles included in posts match the ones provided by the showcased care streamer.

* Accounts suspected of cloning other peopleâ€™s channels, support links, or abusing this community via identity theft will be removed and reported to authorities for investigation. 

* /streamyourcare members are advised to certify authenticity with each care streamer before making contributions to support links like CashApp, Venmo, GoFundMe or PayPal. 

* **[Story]** posts are for educational purposes **only**. If information is widely available to the public, you are allowed to defensively corroborate your story with reports. Although, it is not recommended. 
Confidentiality remains a priority for respecting the safety, privacy, and dignity of impacted individuals.

- **Care streams** should not attempt to further incriminate healthcare workers. They provide better Patient-Provider relationships with [trust](https://www.reddit.com/r/streamyourcare/comments/1ao1b5n/research_relevant_to_care_streaming/), [intervention](https://www.reddit.com/r/streamyourcare/comments/1ayc3my/dbis_privacy_commands/), and [engagement opportunities](https://medium.com/@faulknerfellowship/collaborative-care-stream-content-ideas-for-content-creators-and-family-77124a3ae1cd). 

More updates will be added to this as we scale.
