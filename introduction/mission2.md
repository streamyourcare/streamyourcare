# This is What We Get When Healthcare is a Business

From Roger "[Living in a Wheelchair](https://twitch.tv/livinginawheelchair)" Faulkner's [Medium](https://roger-rethinker.medium.com/this-is-what-we-get-when-health-care-is-a-business-c3198f3c6257) and [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E7v559A67Rz1vM7Hn7BopdmjHGZATf_-DsxS81OYkJA/edit?usp=drivesdk):

> I have ALS, and my mind is clear. In fact I have been a contributing member of society through my inventions. 
> I've run out of money and so I can't continue to live independently. But I'm not able to get on Medicaid without having a lawyer. I thank God that in my case, my family is able to help me do this.

> Nursing homes are all private businesses. The caregivers are often very great people, but they don't get to let me in... The administrators rule the roost. And their eyes are firmly on profit.
> I have been rejected by multiple nursing homes. Most of them can't take me because I'm on positive pressure ventilation. `

> In North Carolina, the ones that can take ventilator patients won't take me unless I get a tracheostomy which would prevent me from speaking.
> My daughter found several nursing homes in Ohio that might take me, but two of them have already rejected me. `

> No one has to take me and in both of those nursing homes, caregiver staff were ready to welcome me, but the administrators said no because my care is relatively complicated and they thought they would lose money.

> I am sure that thousands of people everyday in America are facing a very similar problem. This is what you get when for profit insurance companies, nursing homes, and hospitals call the shots.

Roger wrote this on June 2nd, 2021. Days later, he moved from North Carolina to Ohio into a long term care facility near some of his family. 9 days after admission to the facility, he was neglected and died live on stream. His cause of death was reported as ALS. 

Had he not gone live that morning, nobody would know [what actually happened](https://trellis.law/case/39153/cv-2022-05-1740/estate-roger-faulkner-vs-falls-village-skilled-nursing-rehabili) to Roger Faulkner. Roger used his platform to educate the world about resilience and advocating for your needs through streaming your care.
