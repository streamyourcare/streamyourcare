# Community Building
Share your communities online to increase the funnels that direct advocates towards your community.

### Tips 
- Most content creator communities online are primarily focused on self-promotion. Sharing when you are live in these groups tends to not have much of an impact on your viewership although posting your channel description in the ```#introductions``` channel
