## Anti-Shadowban Guide

- **Warm Your Account**: Establish yourself as a regular user on the application before you try to begin fundraising or community-building.

- Who you follow and interact with will determine who TikTok shows your profile to

- Using too many hashtags will too finely curate your content for their algorithm, significantly halting the potential traffic you could be getting to your page and posts

- **10-20 Posts Rule:** Avoid any form of advertisement, promotion, sharing in the first 15-20 posts you make. If TikTok detects that you might be trying to sell anything with your account, they'll significantly bottleneck your page traffic. 

### Flaggable Activity:
- **Spam**: Avoid following/liking/sharing posts in bulk, TikTok will make it so you are unable more accounts for 1-14 days if you spam-follow or like posts.

- **Deleting Videos:** TikTok is not a fan of new accounts deleting videos, if you need to remove a video due to an error in the post, you can change the privacy 

- **Link Sharing**: Sharing links in posts, LIVE feeds, or comments is not permitted, doing so repeatedly can make TikTok suspicious of the legitimacy of your account. 

- **L33TSP34K:** Using letters and special characters throughout your words is a suspicious activity which TikTok detects as trying to bypass profanity and safety filters in comments/LIVE chats. **Example: 3x4mp13**

### Inclusion vs Over-inclusion (Shadow Ban Paranoia Avoidance)
Don't be too focused on whether or not you might be shadow banned. Take a short break from the app **if you**:
- Can't follow any accounts, like any posts
- Your videos aren't getting any engagement (<100-200 views)
- Avoid checking or posting about getting shadowbanned on Reddit.
