# Introduction
Care streaming is the act of documenting your life while receiving care for a disability, illness, aging, or in long-term-care facility environments. Livestreaming ([with the proper tools](FEATURES.md)) can significantly improve your quality of life and care. Check if you can livestream in a facility where you are [here](healthcare/livestreaming/README.md).

We are conducting interviews with care streamers for a user experience research study. [Sign up](https://forms.gle/84jCDNmTMQyeATMo6) or reach out to ```.mundi``` or ```.myuserid``` on [Discord](https://discord.gg/vUMkT9mxzf).
