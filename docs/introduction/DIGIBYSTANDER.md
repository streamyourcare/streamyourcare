**Distract**: Create a diversion to interrupt problematic behavior, allowing the target to distance themselves from the situation.

**Delegate**: Seek assistance from friends, relevant authority figures and organizations to collaboratively resolve the issue.

**Document**: Capture photo/video evidence to provide evidence and support for the victim.
