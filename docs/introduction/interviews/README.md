#### Insights
Shawn Anderson (@EddieMancuso/@ta51722) has been sharing his medical journey online. Shawn has Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS), a rare and severe form of arthritis that causes him constant pain. He describes the pain like rubber bands pulling down on his shoulders. Due to his bedsores, he is unable to take most of the medications for his AS.

Anderson began livestreaming while hospitalized for bedsores/ulcers. He found that TikTok in particular provided a therapeutic outlet and helped him cope with the chaos and trauma of his experience. However, he was eventually banned from the platform, which left him feeling lost and distraught.

The hospital staff were not receptive to Shawn's livestreaming, claiming it violated HIPAA regulations. They insisted he turn his stream off, or to put it away when they entered his room. Shawn believes this was in part retaliation for a negative Google review he posted about the facility.

Shawn emphasizes the importance of having an advocate present during hospital stays, as he witnessed many patients who weren't properly cared for because they lacked someone to speak up for them. He expresses frustration with the healthcare system, particularly with what he perceives as the overprescribing of drugs and the influence of pharmaceutical companies. He advocates for patients to be informed and to ask questions during each step of the process to recovery.

Despite the challenges he has faced, Shawn remains optimistic and finds solace in his online community. He expresses gratitude for the support he has received from his viewers and emphasizes the importance of kindness. He believes that people should strive to be a positive force in the world and find ways to help each other.


## Brian Jones

#### Insights
Brian Jones (@BrianJones2702) uses social media platforms like TikTok to share his experiences in Georgia nursing homes and advocate for improved care for residents. Confined to a bed after an accident at age 44, Jones became acutely aware of the negligence and abuse occurring around him. He notes he had plenty of time to observe what was happening, as his only time out of his room was for physical therapy twice a week, and nurses gossiped about him and other patients at the nurses station just 10 feet from his room door. 

Brian has documented multiple instances where nurses were belligerent, intoxicated, and negligent. According to Jones, the nursing home prioritized filling beds over providing quality care. He believes that many issues stem from a lack of teamwork and respect among staff members. For example, he criticizes unit managers and those in charge of supplies and scheduling for not assisting CNAs when they are short-staffed. 

Jones' advocacy through platforms like TikTok caught the attention of 11Alive news, who interviewed him and aired a story on the conditions he described. A day after the story aired, he was discharged from the facility he had been staying at for several years. One of his videos even reached the Georgia Stage Capitol through a follower's daughter who showed it to congressmen during a livestream. Jones advocates for keeping loved ones at home with home healthcare services whenever possible, as he believes that is the best way to ensure their well-being. However, for those situations where nursing home care is unavoidable, he suggests to check up on those you know being treated, or the conditions they may face could take a turn for the worse.
