**Client Dedication**: Provide long-term care for clients, staying with them for many years until their passing. Aim to build strong relationships that may lead to being named in wills.

**Engaging Patients with Cognitive Impairments**: Use puzzles, games, and matching games as tools for engaging patients with memory issues. Find these items at garage sales for affordability. Utilize the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test for assessing Alzheimerâ€™s and dementia patients, and consider sourcing materials from garage sales.

**Outdoor Activities**: Emphasize the importance of outdoor activities, such as walks, visits to the park, or simply sitting outside. These activities can be uplifting for patients, especially those who may feel confined indoors. Involve patients in activities like baking or cooking, tailoring the tasks to their abilities and preferences.

**Structured Schedules in Facilities**: Implement structured schedules that include time for outdoor activities and exercise for patients in facilities. Ensure flexibility in these schedules, particularly when weather conditions are unfavorable.

**Ethical Concerns**: Be aware of the prevalence of elder abuse, including physical and financial abuse by caregivers and family members. Advocate for the use of cameras in homes to protect vulnerable individuals and encourage families to adopt this practice.

**Challenges in Facilities**: Maintain a high standard of care in facilities by addressing neglect, understaffing, and lack of proper training for staff. Avoid locking patients in their rooms due to fire hazards. Address high turnover rates among staff by ensuring adequate compensation to improve patient care.

**Advocacy for Clients**: Actively intervene when witnessing mistreatment or neglect. Report concerns to authorities and ensure the well-being of clients.
